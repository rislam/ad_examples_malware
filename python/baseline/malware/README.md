# Malware detection

In this project we are focusing on Active Learning approaches to Update the previously trained classifier.

* Dataset: In total we have 22492 instances in the CSV file. They are sroted by years (i.e. examples from 2010 comes before 2011.)
`The dataset is not public yet we will release it soon`

* Start with the experiments
[script](https://gitlab.eecs.wsu.edu/-/ide/project/100119/ad_examples/blob/master/-/python/run_baseline.sh) it internally handles the [experiment file](https://gitlab.eecs.wsu.edu/-/ide/project/100119/ad_examples/blob/master/-/python/experiment.sh)

so, in `aeolus` the command `bash run_baseline.sh` will work

Locally running: from this directory run the following

`python -m baseline.malware.baseline_experiments --filedir "" --datafile "DATA_LOCATION/malware-all_1.csv" --val_frac 0 --find_top 300 --base_clf RF --query_budget 500`


The basic active learning was using this [library](https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
